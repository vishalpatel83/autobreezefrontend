                    booking confirmation handy. This might be an email or a text
                    message that includes details like your reservation number,
                    pick-up address, and any special instructions.

                    Have your driver's license and a credit card ready. Most
                    rental agencies require a valid driver's license and a

                    When the car arrives, take a moment to inspect it for any
                    existing damage and confirm that it’s clean and in good
                    condition. It’s always a good idea to document any issues
                    with photos.

                    Ensure that you understand the payment process. With AutoBreeze’s no hidden fees promise, there shouldn’t be any surprises, but it’s still a good idea to clarify any charges before you confirm.
